The project titled “Online Crime Complaint System” is to develop an online crime
report and managing system which is easily accessible to the public. This system
registers the complaints from people through online and it will also helpful to police
department in catching criminals, in system and person can give any complaint at any
time. In the proposed System, an online solution is very useful as the solution is
inherently distributive. This distributive characteristic of the online solution helps in
getting the different police stations to share information and get in contact with one
another.The rapid development of computer technology and the integration of
computer and communication technology have made significant changes to human
information activities. Firstly, the efficient and effective power of information
processing has made computer the most important tool for data processing. As a
result, more and more data are processed and stored in computer systems. Secondly,
the transcend nature of the Internet has made it one of the major channels for human
communication. Consequently, our society is in a state of transformation toward a
“virtual society,” where people’s daily activities, such as shopping, getting services,
and especially sharing information, can be accomplished without face-to-face contact
with others. Nowadays, computers and computer networks are ubiquitous and used in
every facet of modern society. Although information technology has enabled global
businesses to flourish, it also becomes one of the major enablers for unscrupulous
individuals to commit crime and escape apprehensions by law enforcement agencies.

## Synopsis

The project titled “Online Crime Complaint System” is to develop an online crime
report and managing system which is easily accessible to the public. This system
registers the complaints from people through online and it will also helpful to police
department in catching criminals, in system and person can give any complaint at any
time. In the proposed System, an online solution is very useful as the solution is
inherently distributive. This distributive characteristic of the online solution helps in
getting the different police stations to share information and get in contact with one
another.
The main scope of this project is to develop an online crime report and managing
system which is easily accessible to the people. This system provides proper security
and reduces the manual work. This proposed system tries to eliminate or reduce
difficulties up to some extent. This system will help the user to reduce the workload
and mental conflict. It helps the user to work user friendly and he can easily do his
jobs without time lagging.Theadvantages are,
● Ensure data accuracy
● Proper control of the higher authority
● Minimize manual data entry
● Greater efficiency
● Better service
● User friendliness and interactive
● Minimum time required
● Minimum time needed for the various processing

### PROPOSED SYSTEM

An online solution is very useful as the solution is inherently distributive.
This distributive characteristic of the online solution helps in getting the different
police stations to share information and get in contact with one another. It is the
Citizen who is benefited a lot through Crime Report. In the manual System,
registration of FIR was not done 100% accurately for various reasons. Certain
mandatory information needed was also not collected either the complainant
furnished vague information or much thought was not given to the importance of the
information which would have helped later in speeding up the investigation process.
The System’s insistence for certain mandatory information at the time of registration
of complaint automatically improved the responsiveness of the Police and in turn is
building up sensitivity. Once a complaint is registered, it is electronically transferred
to the higher authorities. Consequently, the scopes for delinquencies such as nonacceptance of a complaint, loss of track of case, etc are totally eliminated. The present 
system insists for systematic collection of data without missing the important details.
Documents are seen by supervisory officials. The senior officers are in a position to 
keep track of all the cases registered, including those transferred.
